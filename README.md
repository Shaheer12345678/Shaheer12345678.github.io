# Personal Portfolio – Shaheer Shakir

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, built with **HTML** and **CSS** and deployed using **GitHub Pages** at:

👉 https://shaheer12345678.github.io

The site is meant to give a quick overview of who I am as a developer, what I work on, and where to find my projects.

The portfolio includes:

- **Hero section** – Name, title, short summary, quick links to GitHub and LinkedIn

- **Skills** – Key languages, tools, and concepts I’ve worked with  
- **Projects** – Highlighted projects with short descriptions and links to their GitHub repos
